# New concept
Metos3D 1.0.0 introduces a new concept of usage,

we distinguish ??? installation types:

- container/executable, easy to install and use, hard coded, one for each model, inflexible
- script/system, requires [mpi versions of c and fortran compilers](), as well as a compiled version of [petsc](), fully flexible
