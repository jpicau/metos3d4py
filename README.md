# Introducing Metos3D version 1.0.0
following [sematic versioning]() ...
known as: **major.minor.patch** ...

a change in major version, means loss of compatibility

we hybernated the development of Metos3D in separated repositories,
the avaiable versions are:

<!--```
metos3d v0.6.*
simpack v0.6.*
model   v0.4.*
data    v0.2.*
```
-->
- `metos3d v0.6.*`
- `simpack v0.6.*`
- `model   v0.4.*`
- `data    v0.2.*`

all git repositories were archieved as one file and can be downloaded [here](),
each repo includes its earlier versions,
access to versions use in [Piwonski and Slawig, 2016]()

# New concept
Metos3D 1.0.0 introduces a new concept of usage,
one repository,

we distinguish ??? installation types:

- container/executable, easy to install and use, hard coded, one for each model, inflexible
- script/system, requires [mpi versions of c and fortran compilers](), as well as a compiled version of [petsc](), fully flexible
